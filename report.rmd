# 1. Introduction
StatsNZ publishes the International Travel dataset monthly, which breaks down border movements entering or leaving New Zealand by various dimensions. This dataset has traditionally been used by (among other use cases) the tourism industry to understand the potential international visitor market and its seasonality, and thus where to best expend efforts such as marketing, or to benchmark operators’ historical performance based on the market available to them at the time.

StatsNZ only visualises International Travel data as an overall time series, with no easy, accessible method for breaking down the time series by the different dimensions available in the dataset. As a result, someone like a tourism operator would have to overcome the learning curve to extract meaningful insights from the spreadsheets StatsNZ publishes, or worse, learning how to use StatsNZ’s _Infoshare_.

With this dataset, traditional charts like a line chart are not as effective due to the overlapping line series of similarly-sized international markets (see Figure 1, next page). Traditional line charts are also limited to conveying a single dimension of a measure. For example, the visualisation in Figure 1 cannot break down each country’s volumes by the purpose of travel without an explosion in the number of series.

A map visualisation is ideal for meaningfully presenting the data in these insights. Placing each country’s volume on a geographic place on the map solves the problem of overlapping data. A map also leverages our intuition of these dimensions. For example, China, Japan and Korea; and US and Canada are grouped closer together. This method can also take advantage of the from-to mapping in this dataset, conveying the data as a network, with nodes as the origin country and destination port, and edges connecting nodes when visitors register in that particular cut of data.

The need for this kind of visualisation has increased as COVID-19 public health measures sent the border into a state of flux, where policy changes can affect border flows in the order of weeks rather than months. With StatsNZ publishing provisional International Travel measures weekly, the data are available to make this a reality.

# 2. Data
StatsNZ has made provisional International Travel data available weekly since 2020. The provisional International Travel dataset is spread across three time series: weekly arrival data, daily arrivals and departures data, and stock estimates of travellers. I will focus on the first time series, which contains the most insightful information, particularly for tourism decision-makers.

This time series uses arrival card data, allowing us to separate NZ residents from overseas visitors and break them down by the purpose of travel (e.g. business, holiday). Other dimensions include their length of stay, the NZ port they arrived in, and their country of residence. One measure is available, the total movements of a particular traveller group. Because this uses arrival cards rather than administrative border data, there is a two-week delay as arrival cards are temporarily rerouted to the Ministry of Health first for public health management.

Because StatsNZ only publishes the last 120 or so weeks of data, I will concatenate the publicly available data with an older version I have obtained.

The map’s network is represented as an edge list, as the dataset already acts like one (with a From = country of residence, To = NZ port mapping). The application simply filters the main data frame (va) with the selected inputs to create the edge list. The edge list also acts as a node list when ignoring the From column, destination nodes are bound to the end of the edge list without a From value.

The edges have no attributes associated with them. There are several attributes associated with the nodes. Its shape conveys whether it is an origin or destination node (circle and square, respectively). Its size represents the volume originating from that node (destination nodes have a constant size to keep all the different ports visible on a world map). Its latitude and longitude places it on the map. The last two attributes will be geocoded using Nominatim, a free query API, querying the node’s name and adding the corresponding latitude and longitude features to said node.

# 3. Application
The main feature of the Explorer is the map, which is centred on New Zealand to emphasise its centrality in the network, which is limited to looking at arrivals to New Zealand. The network is visualised with nodes represented as circles (origin nodes or countries of residence) or squares (destination nodes or NZ ports). The former is sized proportionally to the number of visitors arriving from that particular country to the selected port. Nodes are connected by edges that do not convey any information, and all have edges connecting to the same (currently selected) port.

Two options were investigated when sizing the node. Initially, I thought it would be sensible to have the maximum node size as the largest value in the current data. This method made sense in the static visualisation so that smaller countries’ are maximally distinguishable, particularly during low seasons. However, when I introduced the time dimension, this method was problematic as the sense of size was not consistent as time passed. Therefore, in the final version, the maximum node size is constant with any change in data to keep the sense of volume consistent across different cuts of data.

Another problem with sizing the node was dealing with small values, not just during the border closures but even before the COVID pandemic. Instead of sizing them linearly proportional to their volume (as seen in Figure 2), a logarithm was applied to bring out those small values and slightly compress the larger values, such as Australia.

The edges are not the geodesic from one node to another. I was surprised to find out that such a path between the United Kingdom and New Zealand runs through the Arctic Circle, which looks strange on a map (Figure 3). The edges connecting India, Malaysia and Singapore also blur into each other. Instead, the edges are arbitrary arcs with a slight curve (Figure 2).

The user can interact with the network by hovering over the nodes to see the number of visitor arrivals going through that node. The user can click on the node to change what data is being visualised. Clicking on any node changes the line charts below the map, filtering out figures for that particular node. For example, clicking on Australia allows the user to break down visitor arrivals from Australia by NZ port, travel purpose and length of stay. Clicking on a destination port like Queenstown, for example, breaks down visitor arrivals to Queenstown by country of residence in the first chart. Additionally, clicking on a destination port changes the subnetwork shown, only showing edges connecting to the currently selected port.

The user can use the slider to adjust the week of data being visualised, which has data from April 2019 to the latest data (22 May 2022 at the time of writing). A line graph can be seen in the background of this slider to give a rough indication of the relative volume of the selected week compared to the rest of the time series. Moving around the slider also moves a guide on all three line charts to aid the user in understanding where the current week is in the time series.

The charts below the map allow the user to dive into the time series in greater detail. They are also interactive, allowing the user to hide specific series to focus on a particular subset of data, such as looking at only Australian arrivals or holidaymaker arrivals. In addition, a user can drag their mouse along the chart area to zoom in on a particular region of the x-axis, such as just the 2021 trans-Tasman bubble, and the chart will zoom the y-axis accordingly.

Finally, the sidebar has options for filtering the data by the other categorical dimensions in the data: travel purpose and length of stay. A radio button input was used for both of these, as the set of options is small enough that a drop-down menu would not be needed. This input does not affect the three line charts.

# 4. Insights
One of the biggest learnings from this project was figuring out how to hook up Shiny to my preferred chart engine, a JavaScript library called amCharts, as I already knew how to create fast map visualisations with amCharts. This decision made it much more complex than a regular Shiny app, as I had to write custom event handlers and messages so that amCharts could respond to Shiny input changes and that Shiny could respond to amCharts changes. To keep track of what was going on, I maintained a flow diagram of the data, inputs, reactives and outputs to aid debugging. This diagram was handy, for example, when debugging handling a mouse click on a node. The flow diagram allowed me to understand what happens in response and where to look for the issue. I could trace back that some inputs were being involved in filtering when they should not be, allowing me to quickly reroute the data flow to originate directly from the original data frame.

Another related challenge was working with the strange way StatsNZ structures their CSV files. They include marginal totals for each category, i.e. “Total” was considered a country, purpose of travel, and length of stay, which may be helpful in an application where only filtering takes place but presents a problem in applications like R where a programmer is used to aggregating and summarising categories. For example, when collapsing by the purpose of travel, the observed value can be multiples of what you expect it to be as double counting takes place when the marginal totals are also summed to the final value. I had to check myself and ensure that summarising did not occur when filtering would do the job, or if I needed a summary, I controlled for other variables by finding their totals.

An issue with working with reactive inputs is concurrency. I initially structured the application to update nodes and edges separately, considering the importance of compartmentalising functions. However, I realised that one update might not be finished by the time the other had started. This is a particular issue for constructing edges, which need the nodes to be ready beforehand. Thus, I merged the two updates to ensure they occur synchronously.

A shortcoming of the data was that it was only available from 14 April 2019. I would have liked to have a full year of data to compare any data point to its corresponding week in 2019, enabling me to visualise (either using the edge, or a "ghost" node sized to the 2019 figure behind the real node) what we would have expected at that point in the year (controlling for seasonality) before the COVID-19 pandemic. If I had more time, I would have introduced the monthly International Travel data and broken it up by week to enable such a comparison. However, the robustness of such a method could be questionable.

The final network visualisation is a bit underwhelming, only showing a k-star network with k countries of origin. I would be interested in investigating more complex networks, such as flight booking volumes with through flights (one flight with an intermediary stop) in addition to non-stop flights. The edges could also be mapped with their actual flight routes. However, this extension might introduce complexity that gets in the way of effectively communicating the data.

# 5. Conclusion
The International Travel Data Explorer visualises provisional visitor arrival data from StatsNZ in a novel way, as an interactive network with nodes proportional to the volumes passing through them. This tool enables the user to derive impactful insights more quickly by providing an intuitive way for them to interact with this multi-dimensional dataset.

This project offered many learnings for me, particularly learning how to use Shiny on top of my pre-existing knowledge around my favourite chart engine, amCharts. This involved dealing with custom reactives and event messages and handlers and debugging concurrent code. It also helped me realise what a bad data structure looks like: keeping marginals as a valid level is a questionable decision on StatsNZ’s part.
